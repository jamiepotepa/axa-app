// TODO
// update Readme to explain how to run the app and give some explanation of the code

//* Separate components and styles
//* Cancel button in the modal needs to clear the form and close the modal
//* Take out case for search
//* Add search functionality - use Debounce
//* Put header section and filter into their own components?
//* Need error handling if a fetch fails. Some sort of message. !ok
//* Add edit note functionality - If I do, make sure to change the submit button text to read update
//* add type button to all button that are not submit
//* update modal to use children so I have a reusable modal component - I could use this for the delete note modal to say, are you sure you want to delete this note?
//* Add notes section to own component and use early returns - if you do this, set up context for the notes
//* Add con currently so one npm command starts frontend and backend
//* Change name of this component to be more generic AddNoteForm
