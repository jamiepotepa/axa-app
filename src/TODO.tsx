// TODO
// Need error handling if a fetch fails. Some sort of message. !ok
// Move fetches to hooks?
// Add edit note functionality - If I do, make sure to change the submit button text to read update
// update Readme to explain how to run the app and give some explanation of the code
// Change search-and-filter naming to search if I don't implement the filter
// Clean up debounce if component gets unmounted?
//? Maybe the filter could switch between searching the title of content of each note
// add type button to all button that are not submit
// update modal to use children so I have a reusable modal component - I could use this for the delete note modal to say, are you sure you want to delete this note?

// Russells suggestions
// Potentially add a couple of unit tests to show I can
// Separate network requests into their own file outside of the hooks
// Discriminated unions for the fetch requests return types
// Add notes section to own component and use early returns - if you do this, set up context for the notes
// maybe add errors as a type to the fetch requests
// Add con currently so one npm commmand starts frontend and backend

// README
// Explain how to run the app.
// Explain 5000 error and what needs to be changed if that port is not available
// Add animation to modal open and close
// Change name of this component to be more generic AddNoteForm

//? Check typescript for onClick events etc

//* Separate components and styles
//* Cancel button in the modal needs to clear the form and close the modal
//* Take out case for search
//* Add search functionality - use Debounce
//* Put header section and filter into their own components?
